Hacktoberfest has been pretty fun. I've really enjoyed reaching out to the open source community and (hopefully) working to make code stronger and more robust. Plus, I should be getting a pretty sweet free t-shirt. Some of the projects I've contributed to during Hacktoberfest...

+ # [Bijingus-guitar-chord-shortcodes-for-wordpress](https://github.com/Bijingus/guitar-chord-shortcodes-for-wordpress)
this one was pretty friggin sweet. Basically it's a plugin for WP that allows you to add chord diagrams to posts/pages by using a simple shortcode and a couple of parameters (the fingering, and placement). For this project I added functionality to create banjo chord diagrams. I'd like to add a bit more functionality, like choosing different tunings for the banjo, and only showing the 5th string if it is in proximity fo the chord being played. Check it out...

+ # [sk5e-banjo-tuner](https://github.com/skr5e/banjo-tuner)
this was another really cool project to add to, and one that I hope to eventually help become a lot more robust. It's a simple tuner web app, built with good ol' HTML/CSS/JS; it allows you to choose different tunings, which was the coolest part to me. Due to an unfortunate accident with a car and my banjo I am unable at the moment to record more tunings/notes to add, but hopefully I will have a nice new banjo ( that I am bartering for with a website for a banjo bulider ;) ). For this project all I've done so far is add a bit of styling and re-arrange some JS slightly, to allow it to visually change the notes for each different tuning.

+ # [redvince-chord_toolkit_php](https://github.com/redvince/chord_toolkit_php)
again, the open source community is full of super cool projects, and this one was no exception. This is a full web app, complete with user registration, which will allow the user to see all the different chords that can be played within a certain key. For this project all I did was add a bit of styling because everything else is pretty solid. I've got a bit more work to do to make this app fully mobile responsive; and I'd also like to some different keys/modes.. like blues scales and so forth.

oh, and Happy HALLOWEEN!
